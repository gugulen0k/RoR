### Implemented requirements:

* The application should use PostgreSQL 
* Basic authentication using devise gem
* CRUD for Merchants (replaced `extra(jsonb)` field with `phone(string)` and `website(string)` fields)
* Validations for each merchant
* Full-text search filter by merchant name
* Integrated **Bootstrap** and added some css styles to the created pages so they look good
* Roles for users, so they can(not) CRUD merchants depending on their role
